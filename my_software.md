## 1. Desktop Environment(DE)
> A desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated applications and utilities. Most importantly, desktop environments provide their own window manager, which can however usually be replaced with another compatible one.

For myself, I love the `ked plasma`. [Kde Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is beautiful DE that you can customize it by yourself, and it provides a comprehensive system settings and freely adjustable pannels for you. 

Other DEs:
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
- [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/)
- [Deepin DE](https://www.deepin.org/en/dde/)
- Cutefish DE (*development has stopped*)
- [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) 
    > The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.
- [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-desktop): Cinnamon is the principal desktop environment of the Linux Mint distribution
- [Budgie](https://github.com/buddiesofbudgie/budgie-desktop)
- [Pantheon](https://elementary.io/)
- [LXQt](https://lxqt-project.org/)
- [Lxde](https://www.lxde.org/)
- [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/)
- [Trinity](https://www.trinitydesktop.org/)
- [Lumina](https://lumina-desktop.org/)

## 2.Image Viewer
There are a lot of image viewers you can choose, and I am using `gwenview`. You can find your favourite image viewer through this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Multimedia#Image_viewers) page.
