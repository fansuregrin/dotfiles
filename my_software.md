## 1. Desktop Environment(DE)
> A desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated applications and utilities. Most importantly, desktop environments provide their own window manager, which can however usually be replaced with another compatible one.

For myself, I love the `ked plasma`. [Kde Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) is beautiful DE that you can customize it by yourself, and it provides a comprehensive system settings and freely adjustable pannels for you. 

## 2.Image Viewer
There are a lot of image viewers you can choose, and I am using `gwenview`. You can find your favourite image viewer through this [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Multimedia#Image_viewers) page.
